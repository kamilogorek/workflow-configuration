# Workflow configuration

This repository is my attempt at configuring a modern web development environment. I'm trying to cut out using things like Foundation and Bootstrap in order to reduce the amount of bloat in my code.

I was keeping up with the rise of ECMAScript 6 on the web, but the amount of different requirements and libraries that then needed configuring baffled me. After finding [Dev.to](https://dev.to), I stumbled across an article titled [Setting up a Minimal, Yet Useful JavaScript Dev Environment](https://dev.to/corgibytes/setting-up-a-minimal-yet-useful-javascript-dev-environment). I followed the process in this article and I now have a Test Driven Development (TDD) environment configured on my MacBook.

I had heard of test driven development before, but not in JavaScript. I'm going to use this repository as a chance to get familiar with a modern development workflow. It can also act as a sandbox where I can test new libraries which may make the workflow more efficient than it was before.
